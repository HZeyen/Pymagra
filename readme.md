# Pymagra

Software package for treatment of potential field data (magnetics and gravity).
It is mainly thought for treatment of Geometrics gradiometer data (.stn format), but several other data formats are read like Surfer format (Geometrics exportation .dat), gxf or BRGM aeromagnetic files.

**This project is under active development**

Installation:

    pip install pymagra

May be called from a command window by typeing: pymagra followed by Enter.

Another possibility (preferred by myself) is to download symagra_script.py and run it, e.g., from Spyder. In this way, you may define in the variable dir0 (line 18) the working folder if you plan to work a longer time on the same data set.
